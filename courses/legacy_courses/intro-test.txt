**Inventory management is a balancing act.**

**Sales** wants more products in stock, so they can fulfill customer demand quickly and avoid missed opportunities.

**Finance** wants fewer products in stock, because excess inventory ties up working capital and increases carrying costs.

**Supply chain** sits in the middle – balancing service levels, lead times, and overall cost efficiency.

Striking this balance is difficult. When it’s managed without the right visibility and insights, it creates unwanted complexity.

**The consequences are costly.**

In fact, most companies are sitting on 15–35% excess inventory, as a result of their balancing act failing. This hidden burden silently drains resources in three critical ways:
