Inventory Is the Lifeblood of Your Business

Your inventory is where all business decisions end up.

Sales wants more.

Finance wants less.

Supply chain sits in the middle – balancing service levels, lead times, and cost.

That balance is hard, but mastering it is key to running a healthy, profitable business.

Why? Unwanted complexity.

It shows up in three ways:

-**Rising inventory and working capital**  
You’re stocking more than you need – and tying up cash unnecessarily.

-**Too low turnover rate**
Inventory moves too slowly, dragging down efficiency.

-**Obsolete goods and write-offs**
Products sit untouched until they expire or get written off.
