Inventory Is the Lifeblood of Your Business. 
Your inventory is where all business decisions end up.

**Sales** wants more.

**Finance** wants less.

**Supply chain** sits in the middle – balancing
service levels, lead times, and cost.

That balance is hard - but mastering it is key to
running a healthy, profitable business.

**When this balancing act fails, the result is costly.** 

Most companies are sitting on 15–35% excess inventory. 
This imbalance silently drains resources in three critical ways:
