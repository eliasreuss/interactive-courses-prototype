You already know that a reorder point is the stock level that triggers a new order. The reorder quantity is simply the amount of products you order when that trigger is reached.

In the graphic, the reorder quantity is shown as the sharp vertical rise in stock - the “refill” that brings inventory back up to its maximum, ready for the next period of sales.

Before we begin learning how to achieve the most optimal reorder quantity, we first need to establish three common terms you have probably encountered before:

With the key terms defined, we can address the common dilemmas buyers face every day.  Effective inventory management means balancing three variables:

**Unit price:** Lower costs per item, often achieved by buying larger quantities

**Demand:** Having enough stock to serve customers

**Inventory turn ratio:** Converting stock into cash quickly

You cannot simply maximize all three at once. If you chase the lowest **unit price**, your **turn ratio** will suffer. If you keep stock too low to improve **turn ratio**, you might risk failing **demand.**

index_title: Tunnel vision on unit price
title: **The trap: tunnel vision on unit price**
type: main
---
One of the most common mistakes we see is ignoring this balance and focusing only on getting a “great deal” on unit price.

In an ideal world, the order quantity that offers the lowest unit price would perfectly match your actual Demand.

**But in reality, these numbers rarely align.**

To secure a low unit price, you are often incentivized to order far more stock than you currently need.

When price becomes the sole focus, the balance breaks. This kind of tunnel vision overlooks actual demand and leads to poor inventory decisions.

Consider this example: you sell just 100 units of a slow-moving C-item per year. Your supplier offers two options: buy 100 units at full price, or 1,000 units with a 20% discount.

At first glance, the larger order looks like a win. But choosing this option comes with a hidden cost.

type: main

Let's play out that decision. You accepted the discount and bought 1,000 units. Since you only sell 100 units a year, **you have effectively bought stock for 10 years.**

You may have saved a small amount on the unit price, but you have destroyed your inventory turnover ratio. You have tied up capital in products that will sit gathering dust for a decade.

**So, how do we avoid this?**

Instead of focusing only on getting the lowest unit price, we shift our attention to how long we want the product in stock.

Using your double ABC analysis to guide this decision helps balance demand, unit price, and inventory turn ratio in a healthy way.

For CA items - products that are inexpensive and sell in high volumes - it makes sense to buy larger quantities. Think of paper clips. You get a better price, they sell quickly, and excess isn’t very expensive to hold.

For AC items, the situation is very different. Take a copy machine: it is expensive, sells slowly and the demand fluctuates. Buying large quantities ties up capital, lowers inventory turnover, and increases the risk of costly excess stock.
