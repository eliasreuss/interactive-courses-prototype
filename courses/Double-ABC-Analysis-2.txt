**To understand Double ABC, let’s start with its foundation:**

**The Double ABC Analysis builds on the classic ABC method — a simple but powerful way to apply the 80/20 rule, also called the Pareto principle.**![image/size:400px/align:stack-right/frame:none](Closet.png)

Think of your closet: you probably wear just 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. 
The same is true for your inventory — a small share of items drives most of the value.

**The ABC Analysis is used for...**
**...focusing on what truly creates value..**

In short: a small part of your products generate the majority of your revenue.

With ABC Analysis, you divide your products into three groups:

-**A items** – the top ~10% of products that generate around 80% of your revenue
-**B items** – the next ~20% that bring in about 15% of revenue
-**C items** – the remaining ~70% of products that only make up 5% of revenue

Not familiar with the 80/20 rule or ABC method? Watch the short intro video first.

Already know it? Perfect — **let’s move on.**

You’ve just learned how a simple ABC Analysis works, but that isn’t the whole story.

The Double ABC Analysis adds a second dimension: **Not just how much you sell, but also how often.**

**Double ABC Analysis is a way to rank your products using two factors at the same time instead of just one:**

-**Frequency** → how often the product is purchased.
-**Revenue** → how much money the product generates.

Each product is scored on both factors using the ABC scale:

-**A = high, B = medium, C = low.** 

These two ratings are then combined into a two-letter category. 

**Watch the video for a more thorough walkthrough, or skip ahead to dive straight into an example.**

**Let’s apply it to a paper company:**

**AA items**
High revenue, high frequency

→ Your everyday heroes. Like copy paper in an office. Easy to manage. Low risk.

**Let’s apply it to a paper company:**

**AC items**
High revenue, low frequency

→ Big-ticket items sold occasionally. Like a copy machine. Valuable – but riskier to keep in stock.

**Let’s apply it to a paper company:**

**CC items**
Low revenue, low frequency

→ Generate very little income, rarely sells. Like plastic sleeves. Important to manage carefully – or phase out.

**And just like that, every product in your inventory will be assigned a double ABC category.**

It will help you understand **not just what sells – but how it sells.**

Where a single ABC Analysis looks at revenue alone, Double ABC adds a second lens: demand patterns. It shows you both how valuable a product is – and how predictable it is.

**Note:** Revenue and frequency are just examples of axes you can use for the analysis. The best choice of axes will always depend on your specific goals.

**Click the left button to explore examples of different axes and how they can shape your analysis. Or, continue on the main path if you’d like to move ahead.**

Knowing in which categories your products lie is extremely important for making smart inventory decisions.

**In Inact Now, we’ve already set up a Double ABC Analysis for you.**

Let’s take a look at your own stock – and see how your products are distributed across the different categories.

What you’re looking at is called an **Insight.**

Insights are simple, powerful views that give you a clear understanding of your data.
 After completing these courses, you’ll be able to **create, edit, and share your own Insights**, giving you full control over what you see – and how you see it.

But for now, let’s focus on this Insight we've prepared for you.

title: **What do the numbers mean?**
type: main

You’re looking at an overview of your own inventory — and how your products are distributed across the Double ABC categories.

**Let’s break down what the numbers tell us:**

**Inventory Value** – Your current total inventory value
**Cost of Goods Consumed (12 months)** – The total cost of inventory used over the past year
**Total Products** – The total number of individual products in your inventory

Beneath these key figures, you’ll find **your inventory segmented by Double ABC classification.**

This is a great opportunity to ask yourself: does the current product distribution support your goals?

title: **What about items that don’t quite fit?**
type: main
---
When people first see their Double ABC Analysis, a common question is:

**“What about items that don’t quite fit?”**

For example, new products often appear as low-performing (like CC) simply because they haven’t had time to generate sales. That doesn’t mean they lack potential.

That’s why the Inact Now view goes **beyond the standard nine categories.** We’ve added **six extra classifications** to capture special cases—like new, discontinued, or strategic items—so you can act with more nuance.

**Let’s explore these categories and see how they guide smarter decisions.**

[title: **The company’s ABC categorization depends on the purpose.**]
-If the company wants to increase delivery reliability and/or reduce inventory, the recommended dimensions are consumption, order lines, and possibly standard deviation.

-As a starting point, the ABC model is set up according to 80 / 15 / 5 %, after which fixed thresholds can be established if needed. Fixed thresholds make it easier to communicate to the rest of the organization – e.g., an AA item is defined as having consumption > 250,000 DKK and 50 order lines per year.

-The more commercial dimensions are added to the analysis when the company wants to analyze the product life cycle and sales.
