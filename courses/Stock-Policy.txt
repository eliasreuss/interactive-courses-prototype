hero_body: In this course, we move from understanding your data to making decisions with it. We will explore how to establish clear, effective policies that differentiate between which items to keep on the shelf and which to phase out.

title: **The ultimate question**

The first question an organisation should ask themselves when it comes to inventory management is: 

**Which items actually deserve a spot on our shelves?**

It sounds simple, but without a clear, data-driven answer to this question, you are essentially guessing. And when an organization guesses, they risk filling their inventory with products that add no value, while possibly standing in the way of those that do.

When we don't have a strict answer to "what to stock," the result is a messy inventory that hurts the bottom line. Without a differentiated policy, we often see two painful extremes happening at the same time:

It is the worst of both worlds: high costs and poor service.

index_title: What's the cure?
title: **The solution**
type: main

The cure for this is to stop treating every item equally. We need to apply different policies based on the ABC categories you learned.

**For your A-items** — those with high, stable demand — you'll almost always want to keep them in stock. This is the best way to guarantee high service levels for your most important products and customers.

**For your C-items**, those with lumpy demand and high uncertainty, the opposite is true. Making them “buy-to-order” or “make-to-order” is often the smartest move to avoid tying up cash in items that might not sell for months.

By applying those specific rules - stocking the winners and ordering or making the sporadic items on demand, you are actively managing the trade-offs between service and capital. A well-defined stock policy serves four distinct strategic purposes:

You’ve learned how to set clear boundaries for your inventory - defining exactly which products earn a spot on the shelf and which should be bought to order or made to order.

Now that you know **what to stock**, the next step is determining **how much stock** - and how to handle the unexpected.

In the **Safety Stock** course, you’ll learn how to:

-Handle uncertainty in demand and lead times
-Calculate the optimal safety stock for your items
-Protect service levels without bloating your inventory

**Let’s keep going!**
