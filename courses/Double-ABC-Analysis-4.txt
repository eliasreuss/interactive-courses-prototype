**To understand Double ABC, it helps to first recall the basics of classic ABC analysis.**

ABC analysis is built on the Pareto principle (80/20 rule), which shows that a small portion of items usually accounts for most of the value.

For example, in a warehouse, a handful of products (the “A” items) may generate the majority of sales or inventory value, while many other products (the “B” and “C” items) contribute far less.

If we for example look at our products demand, we see that a small share of products accounts for most of the demand, while most products contribute very little.

**We can group them into the three categories:**

-**A products** – the top ~10% of products that make up 80% of total demand
-**B products** – the next ~20% of products that cover 15% of demand
-**C products** – the remaining ~70% of products that add up to only 5% of demand

And that’s the idea behind ABC analysis: a few products matter most, while most matter much less.

Now you know the theory behind an ABC analysis, but there’s more:

**The double ABC analysis looks at two variables at the same time instead of just one.** These could for example be:

**1. Cost of inventory** – how much the product cost us over the last 12 months (total cost of goods).
**2. Demand** – how often the product was sold or used in the last 12 months (consumption lines).

index_title: Understanding the double ABC analysis
title: **Understanding the double ABC analysis**
type: main
---
This is how it works: 

Each product gets **two scores**, A / B / C, for each variable. These two scores are combined into a two-letter category. For example:

-**AA** = high cost of inventory, high demand
-**CB** = low cost of inventory, medium demand

This helps you quickly see which products are the most important and decide how to manage them.

**Tip:** You can use Double ABC with any two variables you want — for example, revenue and lead time, or sales and criticality.

Now that you understand the theory, let’s apply it. To make this easy to visualize, we will use a standard office supply inventory as our example.

Take a look at the matrix on the right. We have cost of inventory on the vertical axis and demand on the horizontal axis.

We are going to walk through four critical categories on this grid to see how your management strategy should change based on where a product sits. Let's start at the top left with our high-performers.

**AA items**
High cost of inventory, high demand

→ Your everyday heroes. Like copy paper in an office. Easy to manage. Low risk.

index_title: AC items
title: **Double ABC analysis example**
type: main
---
**AC items**
High cost of inventory, low demand

→ Big-ticket items sold occasionally. Like a copy machine. Valuable but riskier to stock, as they tie up significant capital with little predictability on when — or how many — will sell.

type: main

**CA items**
Low cost of inventory, high demand

→ Often overlooked, but critical for customer experience. Like paperclips or screws in production.

**CC items**
Low cost of inventory, low demand

→ Rarely sells. Like plastic sleeves. Important to manage carefully – or phase out.

**And just like that, every product in your inventory will be assigned a double ABC category.**

Where a single ABC analysis may look at demand alone, Double ABC adds a second lens: cost of inventory. It shows you both how predictable a products demand is - and how expensive it is to hold. 

**Note:** Cost of inventory and demand are just examples of variables you can use for the analysis. The best choice of variables will always depend on your specific goals.

Once everything has a double ABC category, it starts to become genuinely useful. The analysis helps you understand what’s going on in your inventory and where to focus your attention.

Here are a few practical ways it can help:

index_title: What are special categories?
title: **What about items that don’t quite fit?**
type: main
---
When people first see their double ABC analysis, a common question often comes up: **“What about items that don’t quite fit?”**

For example, new products often appear as low-performing (like CC) simply because they haven’t had time to generate sales. That doesn’t mean they lack potential.

That’s why the Inact Now view goes **beyond the standard nine categories.** We’ve added **six extra classifications** to capture special cases—like new, discontinued, or strategic items—so you can act with more nuance.

-If the company wants to increase delivery reliability and/or reduce inventory, the recommended dimensions are consumption, order lines, and possibly standard deviation.

-As a starting point, the ABC model is set up according to 80 / 15 / 5 %, after which fixed thresholds can be established if needed. Fixed thresholds make it easier to communicate to the rest of the organization – e.g., an AA item is defined as having consumption > 250,000 DKK and 50 order lines per year.

-The more commercial dimensions are added to the analysis when the company wants to analyze the product life cycle and sales.
