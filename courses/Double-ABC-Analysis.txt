title: The Pareto principle
type: main

The Double ABC Analysis expands on the classic ABC method, a powerful tool grounded in the 80/20 rule – also known as the Pareto Principle, named after economist Vilfredo Pareto. This method helps identify the small percentage of items that generate the most value, allowing you to focus your efforts where they matter most.

If you're unfamiliar with the Pareto Principle or the ABC method, we recommend watching the introductory video before continuing.

Already familiar? Great — let’s continue on the main learning path.

In short: a small part of your products generate the majority of your revenue.

With ABC Analysis, you divide your products into three groups:

-**A items** – the top ~10% of products that generate around 80% of your revenue
-**B items** – the next ~20% that bring in about 15% of revenue
-**C items** – the remaining ~70% of products that only make up 5% of revenue
