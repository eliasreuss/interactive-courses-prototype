Double ABC Analysis is one of the most powerful tools in inventory optimization, and a a framework for balancing service, cost and profit.

title: The Pareto principle
type: main
---
The Double ABC Analysis expands on the classic ABC method, a powerful tool grounded in the 80/20 rule – also known as the Pareto Principle, named after economist Vilfredo Pareto. This method helps identify the small percentage of items that generate the most value, allowing you to focus your efforts where they matter most.

If you're unfamiliar with the Pareto Principle or the ABC method, we recommend watching the introductory video before continuing.

Already familiar? Great — let’s continue on the main learning path.

title: Summary of the Pareto principe
type: main

In short: a small part of your products generate the majority of your revenue.

With ABC Analysis, you divide your products into three groups:

-**A items** – the top ~10% of products that generate around 80% of your revenue
-**B items** – the next ~20% that bring in about 15% of revenue
-**C items** – the remaining ~70% of products that only make up 5% of revenue

You’ve just learned how a simple ABC Analysis works, but that isn’t the whole story.

The Double ABC Analysis adds a second dimension:

**Not just how much you sell, but also how often.**

Because a product that sells a lot once in a while is very different from a product that sells a little, every day.
In this video, you’ll learn how the Double ABC Analysis works. If you're already familiar, you can continue on the main learning path.

**Understanding not just what sells – but how it sells.**

Where a single ABC Analysis looks at revenue alone, Double ABC adds a second lens: demand patterns.  It shows you both how valuable a product is – and how predictable it is. 

Do you want a quick recap of what some of the key categories mean?

As seen in the video, knowing in which categories your products lie is extremely important for making smart inventory decisions.

**In Inact Now, we’ve already set up a Double ABC Analysis for you.**

Let’s take a look at your own stock – and see how your products are distributed across the different categories.

Click "Open Inact Now" - this will open your organisations own Double ABC Analysis in a new window. Then put the window next to this one to follow the rest of the course. Your screen should look something like this:

title: Your Double ABC Insight
type: main
---
What you’re looking at is called an **Insight** – and we’ve set this one up for you.

Insights are simple, powerful views that give you a clear understanding of your data.

After completing these courses, you’ll be able to **create, edit, and share your own Insights**, giving you full control over what you see – and how you see it.

But for now, let’s focus on this Insight we've prepared for you.

title: What are you looking at?
type: main
---
You’re looking at an overview of your own inventory — and how your products are distributed across the Double ABC categories.

Let’s break down what the numbers tell us:

**Inventory Value** – Your current total inventory value
**Cost of Goods Consumed (12 months)** – The total cost of inventory used over the past year
**Total Products** – The total number of individual products in your inventory

Beneath these key figures, you’ll find your inventory segmented by Double ABC classification. 

This is a great opportunity to ask yourself: **does the current product distribution support your goals?**

title: What about the items that don’t quite fit?
type: main
---
**When people first see their Double ABC analysis, a common question comes up:**

“What about the items that don’t quite fit?”

Some products may technically fall into a certain category — like CC — but don’t really belong there. A good example is newly added items. They might show up as low-performing simply because they haven’t had time to generate sales or revenue yet. But that doesn’t mean they lack potential.

**That’s why, as you’ve probably noticed in the Inact Now view, we’ve gone beyond the standard nine categories.**

We’ve added six extra classifications to give you deeper insight — helping you handle special cases like new, discontinued, or strategic items with the nuance they deserve.

**Let’s walk through these key categories together.**  
Understanding what they mean is essential to making better decisions take the right actions at the right time.

title: Special categories
type: flip-cards

[card]
front: **New**

(Click to read about the category)
back: Items that are newly added to your catalogue.

These may look like poor performers in the ABC analysis, but only because they haven’t had time to generate demand yet.

→ Less than 365 days since first stocking.
[card-separator]
[card]
front: **Discontinued**

(Click to read about the category)
back: Products that are no longer active and should be phased out.

→ Status is marked as discontinued in your ERP system.
[card-separator]
[card]
front: **Dead**

(Click to read about the category)
back: These have been sitting in stock without any demand in the past 12 months.

→ No consumption in the last 12 months, but still in inventory.
[card-separator]
[card]
front: **BTO/MTO (Buy-to-Order / Make-to-Order)**

(Click to read about the category)
back: Items that are only stocked for a confirmed order.

→ They’re not meant for general inventory — flagged as BTO/MTO in ERP
[card-separator]
[card]
front: **Strategic**

(Click to read about the category)
back: Items that are exceptions for a good reason — for example, C-items that are sold to A-customers, or that have a special strategic role.

→ Flagged as strategic based on importance, not performance.

**AA items**
 High revenue, high frequency
→ Your everyday heroes. Like copy paper in an office.  Easy to manage. Low risk.

**AC items**
High revenue, low frequency 
→ Big-ticket items sold occasionally. Like a copy machine.  Valuable – but riskier to keep in stock.

**CA items**
 Low revenue, high frequency 
→ Often overlooked, but critical for customer experience.  Like paperclips or screws in production.

**CC items**
 Low revenue, low frequency  → Make up most of your product catalog, but generate very little income.  Important to manage carefully – or phase out.

**The Double ABC Analysis gives you nine total combinations, helping you:**

-Focus on what matters
-Spot risky or irrelevant stock
-Prioritize your time, attention, and inventory policies
