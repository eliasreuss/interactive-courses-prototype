title: **What is the Double ABC Analysis?**
type: main
---
The Double ABC Analysis is one of the most powerful tools in inventory optimization, and a a framework for balancing service, cost and profit.

The analysis enables the organization to perform inventory diagnosis and formalize invenory management policies.

-**Inventory diagnosis:** Uncover status quo and identify areas for improvement​
-**Alignment:** Align sales and operations around the core business​
-**Prioritization:** Prioritize and focus efforts on high-impact items​
-**Company policy:** Establish planning policies that balance service and cost of inventory​
-**Service:** Concentrate on items that enhance customer satisfaction and minimize stockouts​
-**Efficiency:** Improve the business processes that protect and support core business​
-**Cost:** Lower cost of inventory and turnover ratio with 15-20%

title: **The Pareto principle**
type: main
---
**The Double ABC Analysis builds on the classic ABC method —** 
**a simple but powerful way to apply the 80/20 rule, also called the Pareto principle.**

Think of your closet: you probably wear just 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. 
The same is true for your inventory — a small share of items drives most of the value.

Not familiar with the 80/20 rule or ABC method? Watch the short intro video first.

Already know it? Perfect — **let’s move on.**

title: **So, to recap:**
type: main
---
**The ABC Analysis is used for...**
**...focusing on what truly creates value..**

In short: a small part of your products generate the majority of your revenue.

With ABC Analysis, you divide your products into three groups:

-**A items** – the top ~10% of products that generate around 80% of your revenue
-**B items** – the next ~20% that bring in about 15% of revenue
-**C items** – the remaining ~70% of products that only make up 5% of revenue

title: **Adding another dimension**
type: main
---
You’ve just learned how a simple ABC Analysis works, but that isn’t the whole story.

The Double ABC Analysis adds a second dimension:

**Not just how much you sell, but also how often.**

Because a product that sells a lot once in a while is very different from a product that sells a little, every day.

**In this video, you’ll learn how the Double ABC Analysis works.**
If you're already familiar, you can continue on the main learning path.

In summary: The Double ABC Analysis is used for:

**Understanding not just what sells – but how it sells.**

Where a single ABC Analysis looks at revenue alone, Double ABC adds a second lens: demand patterns. It shows you both how valuable a product is – and how predictable it is.

Knowing in which categories your products lie is extremely important for making smart inventory decisions.

**In Inact Now, we’ve already set up a Double ABC Analysis for you.**

Let’s take a look at your own stock – and see how your products are distributed across the different categories.

title: **Great... What are we looking at?**
type: main

What you’re looking at is called an **Insight.**

Insights are simple, powerful views that give you a clear understanding of your data.
 After completing these courses, you’ll be able to **create, edit, and share your own Insights**, giving you full control over what you see – and how you see it.

But for now, let’s focus on this Insight we've prepared for you.

title: **What do the numbers mean?**
type: main
---
You’re looking at an overview of your own inventory — and how your products are distributed across the Double ABC categories.

**Let’s break down what the numbers tell us:**

**Inventory Value** – Your current total inventory value
**Cost of Goods Consumed (12 months)** – The total cost of inventory used over the past year
**Total Products** – The total number of individual products in your inventory

Beneath these key figures, you’ll find **your inventory segmented by Double ABC classification.**

This is a great opportunity to ask yourself: does the current product distribution support your goals?

title: **What about items that don’t quite fit?**
type: main
---
When people first see their Double ABC Analysis, a common question is:

**“What about items that don’t quite fit?”**

For example, new products often appear as low-performing (like CC) simply because they haven’t had time to generate sales. That doesn’t mean they lack potential.

That’s why the Inact Now view goes **beyond the standard nine categories.** We’ve added **five extra classifications** to capture special cases—like new, discontinued, or strategic items—so you can act with more nuance.

**Let’s explore these categories and see how they guide smarter decisions.**

[card]
front: New

(Click to reveal)
back: Items that are newly added to your catalogue.

These may look like poor performers in the ABC analysis, but only because they haven’t had time to generate demand yet.

→ Less than 365 days since first stocking.
[card-separator]
[card]
front: Discontinued

(Click to reveal)
back: Products that are no longer active and should be phased out.

→ Status is marked as discontinued in your ERP system.
[card-separator]
[card]
front: Dead

(Click to reveal)
back: These have been sitting in stock without any demand in the past 12 months.

→ No consumption in the last 12 months, but still in inventory.
[card-separator]
[card]
front: BTO/MTO (Buy-to-Order / Make-to-Order)

(Click to reveal)
back: Items that are only stocked for a confirmed order.

→ They’re not meant for general inventory — flagged as BTO/MTO in ERP
[card-separator]
[card]
front: Strategic

(Click to reveal)
back: Items that are exceptions for a good reason — for example, C-items that are sold to A-customers, or that have a special strategic role.

→ Flagged as strategic based on importance, not performance.

**AA items**
High revenue, high frequency
→ Your everyday heroes. Like copy paper in an office. Easy to manage. Low risk.

**AC items**
High revenue, low frequency → Big-ticket items sold occasionally. Like a copy machine. Valuable – but riskier to keep in stock.

**CA items**
Low revenue, high frequency → Often overlooked, but critical for customer experience. Like paperclips or screws in production.

**CC items**
Low revenue, low frequency
→ Generate very little income, rarely sells. Like plastic sleeves. Important to manage carefully – or phase out.

**The Double ABC Analysis gives you nine total combinations, helping you:**

-Focus on what matters
-Spot risky or irrelevant stock
-Prioritize your time, attention, and inventory policies
